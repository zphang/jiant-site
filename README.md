# jiant

`jiant` is a software toolkit for natural language processing research, designed to facilitate work on multitask learning and transfer learning for sentence understanding tasks.

A few things you might want to know about jiant:

- `jiant` is configuration driven. You can run an enormous variety of experiments by simply writing configuration files. Of course, if you need to add any major new features, you can also easily edit or extend the code.
- `jiant` contains implementations of strong baselines for the GLUE and SuperGLUE benchmarks, and it's the recommended starting point for work on these benchmarks.
- `jiant` was developed at the [2018 JSALT Workshop](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/workshops/18-workshop/) by the [General-Purpose Sentence Representation Learning](https://jsalt18-sentence-repl.github.io/) team and is maintained by the [NYU Machine Learning for Language Lab](https://wp.nyu.edu/ml2/people/), with help from [many outside collaborators](https://github.com/nyu-mll/jiant/graphs/contributors) (especially Google AI Language's [Ian Tenney](https://ai.google/research/people/IanTenney)).
- `jiant` is built on [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org). It also uses many components from our half-competitor, half-inspiration [AllenNLP](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp).
- The name `jiant` doesn't mean much. The 'j' stands for JSALT. That's all the acronym we have.
